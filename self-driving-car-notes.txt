Self-Driving Car Tasks:
* Localization and Mapping (where am I?)
* Scene Understanding (where is everyone else?)
* Movement Planning (how do I get from A to B?)
* Driver State (what's the driver up to?)


SLAM and autonomy (where am I?):

- End-to-End Visual Odometry:
left video sequence     right video sequence
conbolution             convolution
elemtwise product of 2 convolutions
convolution + pooling
flatten
dense/normal/fully connected layer
softmax
output: velocity direction

- in general:
stereo camera
5 frame sub-sequence
CNN(velocity)   CNN(direction)
local velocity  local change in direction
path

Object Detection (what is around me?):

- deep learning -> recognition, classification, detection
- scene segmentation [ https://github.com/tkuanlun350/Tensorflow-SegNet ]

Movement Planning (where do I go?):

- deep reinforcement learning [ https://github.com/siemanko/tensorflow-deepq ]
