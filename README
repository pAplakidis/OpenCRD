My Thesis for my computer science and telecommunications degree

Subject: Monocular Crossroad Detection (Self-Driving Cars)


GOAL -> Use single camera and solve the following tasks:
*build a net that detects corssroads
*build a net that finds different paths in crossroads (maybe use a SLAM library for that or build my own pathfinder)(not something fancy, just need to draw path of turn, then it's back to basic cruising)
*select a path based on GPS data (just the command: left, right, straight)

NOTES:
- always full stop in crossroads for safety, no matter the sign (might be good to detect it though)
- maybe add small side front facing cameras and SLAM based on all three cameras for crossroad navigation
- either make the images/frames from the cameras panoramic (might be slower but it works with monocular SLAM) or use SLAM for 3 cameras (better precision)
