My Thesis for my computer science and telecommunications degree

Subject: Monocular Crossroad Detection (Self-Driving Cars)


GOAL -> Use single camera and solve the following tasks:
*build a net that detects corssroads
*build a net that finds different paths in crossroads (maybe use a SLAM library for that or build my own pathfinder)
*select a path based on GPS data
