My Thesis for my computer science and telecommunications degree

Subject: Monocular Crossroad Detection and Path Prediction (Self-Driving Cars)


GOAL -> Use single camera and solve the following tasks:
*build a net that detects corssroads (+ how far they are?, might not be possible without SLAM, so may not do that)
*build a net that finds different paths on crossroads (not something fancy, just need to draw path of turn, then it's back to basic cruising) 
*select a path based on desire data (just the command: left, right, forward) (maybe add GPS support)

IMPORTANT:
- no more than one camera or SLAM needed since this is just end-to-end path prediction and not navigation
- need lots of varied datasets (need to label them as well, <crossroad/no-crossroad>, <path car followed>)

- Convolutional Neural Net for Detection and Recurrent (using 2 images at a time?<RNN>) for path planning (need to ground truth desire as well)

Ideas for the future:
- find a good GPS API and just query it for directions
- build a localizer and use that to autolabel path data based on GPUS, IMU, etc (more accurate)
