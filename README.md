# Subject: Monocular Crossroad Detection and Path Prediction using Multi-Task Learning
My Thesis on End-to-End autonomous driving.

## GOAL -> Use single camera and solve the following tasks:
* detect corssroads
* find multiple paths on crossroads
* desire data
* add GPS navigation support

### Ideas for the future:
- use RNN for path planning
- find a good GPS API and just query it for directions
- add the project to a whole self-driving car stack that runs in Carla simulator
