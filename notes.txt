Lessons from Andrej Karpathy's talk in Tesla Autonomy Day [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucp0TTmvqOE&ab_channel=Tesla ]

Neural Network Essentials for DATA:
- Large dataset
- Varied dataset (different scenarios)
- Real dataset (no simulations)
solution: fleet

No more than 2-3 Conv Layers and 1-2 fully connected hidden layers are needed

Steering and Path Prediction:

Depth Perception from Vision:
- No Lidar, it is a vision problem
- Need to not only know whether there is a crossroad or not, but also how far it is
- SLAM + RADAR
- sensor data -> neural network -> surrounding cars in cuboids (size, location, direction)
- self-supervision

FOR PATH PLANNING CHECK THIS [ https://towardsdatascience.com/can-self-driving-car-think-6c9e8d939d60 ]

the neural nets:
- convolutional for crossroad classification -> inputs: YUV image frame, outputs: crossroad class
- recurrent for path planning -> inputs: 2 consecutive YUV image frames + desire (from GPS), outputs path (trajectory output to be followed) + maybe left-right lanes
