TASKS for each NN:

* Primary:
- detect crossroads (DONE)
- predict path in the intersections based on the desired direction (forward, left, right) (DONE)

* Secondary:
- road edge detection (DONE)
- lane detection
- depth estimation? (for crossroads)

TODO:
* evaluation after training
* retrain on the same data, more epochs
* label more data
