TASKS for each NN:

* Primary:
- detect crossroads (DONE)
- predict path in the intersections based on the desired direction (forward, left, right)

* Secondary:
- road edge detection (DONE)
- lane detection
- depth estimation? (for crossroads)

TODO:
* add path planning to ComboModel (debug flat_path, "same" code works for path_planner but not for combo_model)
* add Combo path planning to app.py
* label more data
